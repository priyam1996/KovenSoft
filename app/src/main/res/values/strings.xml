    <string name="description_network">As the data center environment expands, companies must find new ways to improve efficiency.
        To increase performance and improve the availability of data management networks,
        enterprises are migrating the overall system configuration from the traditional direct server-to-storage
        connection to a switched shared server-to-storage connection via fiber-optic cabling.
         Networks are the backbone of your business and periodic evaluation is
        critical to accommodate new applications and to keep pace with business requirements.
        In today's business environment, enabling your network to work with multiple communication channels is paramount.

        robust and resilient network infrastructures. Our end-to-end network integration solutions help
